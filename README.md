# Hello PolyU!

This is a very simple project (probably the simplest you can find) to get your kick started with clion.

All this application does is say hello - but if you can get it to do that, then your install is working!

## Doing it by hand

If you don't want to use clion or you want to do things manually:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pmembrey/hellopolyu.git
    $ cd hellopolyu
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
    $ make
    $ ./hellopolyu

Enjoy! :)
